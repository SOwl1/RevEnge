# Reverse Engineering Challenges

This repo is home to a collection of sample binaries that use common malware techniques safely, provided as challenges as I struggle through learning how to leverage the evasive methods.

I'll try to put out new binaries weekly for anybody who wants to take part in learning triage/reverse engineering with controlled samples before moving into actual malware.
